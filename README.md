# Hangman
A simple Hangman game implemented in Python.</br>
</br>
Hangman is a classic letter guessing game.</br>
Run the script hangman.py.</br>
Type the file path that contain the word that should be guessed and press Enter.</br>
A set of blank letters that match a word will be displayed, and you should guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word.</br>
</br>
If you guess a letter that is in the word, that letter is revealed from the blank letters. However, if you pick a letter that is not in the word, then a stickman is slowly drawn. With each wrong letter guess, the man is drawn more and more. When the man is finished, he is hung and the game is lost. If you reveal all the letters in the word before the man is hung then you are successful and the full word is revealed.
